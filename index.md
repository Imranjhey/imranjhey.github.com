I am a professional lecturer at Informatics Faculty ([School of Computing](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id/en/school-of-informatics/)) of Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia. Currently, I am on leave for finishing my Ph.D at [Doctoral School of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://doktori.math.bme.hu/english/index-E.html) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary, under supervision of [GÃ¡bor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). 


My research interests lie in computational algebra & number theory, and their applications in computer science. Currently, I am working on:
- Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
- HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography, especially for isogeny-based cryptography;
- Computational algebra.
