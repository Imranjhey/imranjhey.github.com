I am a professional lecturer at Informatics Faculty ([School of Computing](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id/en/school-of-informatics/)) of Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia.

Meanwhile, I am finishing my Ph.D at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary, under supervision of [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). 
Previously, I was a master student at Mathematical Institute of Leiden University, Netherlands. I did computational algebraic geometry to study Gröbner bases for decoding linear codes and cryptanalysis in my master thesis under supervision of [Bas Edixhoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_Edixhoven).

My research interests lie in computational algebra & number theory, and their applications in computer science. Currently, I am working on the variants of hidden subgroup problem (HSP) and investigating some HSP-based quantum attacks to some post-quantum cryptographic protocols. 
During my PhD program, I also do teaching for undergraduate courses in Maths and Computer Science at BME.
