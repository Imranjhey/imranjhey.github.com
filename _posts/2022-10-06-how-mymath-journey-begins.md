title: "How my math journey begins"
---
I would like to recall here how I started my math journey. I started to like reading math books when I was in the 2nd year of senior high school. 
I started to be exciting in math not because I found a very cool math problem like most of mathematicians start their story in math. I decided to
do math because of anger, love, and a bit of envy.
